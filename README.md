# CT-Imaging
Projected 2-d phantom and reconstructed back using SIRT implemented in MATLAB. 


Run 
1) circlemain.m - It generates the sinogram of the projection and displays the original image that is being projected on.
2) recons.m- It uses the projection data to reconstruct back the original image.

more details coming soon.
